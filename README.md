# Remove-Duplicate-Cards
Remove Duplicate Cards is an addon of ANKI.

This addon will remove duplicate cards in one deck. Choose "keep old cards, remove new cards", it will keep the oldest card in one duplicate, and remove others. Choose "keep new cards, remove old cards", it will keep the newest card in one duplicate, and remove others. In both choices, it will keep the due date of the oldest card. Besides, you can select a specific field to filter duplicate cards.

After installation, you can find this addon in Tools -> Remove Duplicate Cards. When to use this addon, be sure that you selected the right main key( the cards which have the same main key are dupulicated to each other ). <b>Before you click Execute Plan, please check the plan made by this addon to avoid data loss.</b>

以deck为单位移除重复卡片，可选择保留重复卡片中最新的或者最旧的卡片（到期时间会使用最旧的卡片的到期时间），同时也支持使用特定的标签来筛选需要移除的重复卡片。“保留旧卡片“适用于旧卡片已经被手动修改了的场景，”保留新卡片“适用于需要使用新卡片来代替旧卡片的场景。目前还无法做到既保留修改了意思的旧卡片，又使用新卡片来代替旧卡片。
